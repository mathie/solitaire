# Solitaire Cipher

I'd like to explore unit, and integration, testing in Go, using the standard
library. For this exploration, it's helpful to have a well understood problem
to try and solve while we're learning about Go's testing tools. There are many
sources of 'standard' problems to solve, but my favourite is [Ruby Quiz][]. It
turns out I've already solved the [solitaire cipher in Ruby][solitaire_cipher]
(though I can't remember it at all!), so let's see how we get on with it in Go
this time around.
